## 🚀 Live Demo
**Try the app live here:** [social-media-risk-annalyzer.streamlit.app](https://social-media-risk-annalyzer-5muhcog2gkgi425d6mcvza.streamlit.app/)

*(Note: The application is permanently hosted and updated via Streamlit Community Cloud)*

## Overview

This project investigates the relationship between social media usage habits and student well-being using a real-world survey dataset of **705 students** across multiple countries. The application takes a student's usage profile as input and outputs a **personalised risk score** along with insights into how their habits compare to the broader student population.

**Key questions this project answers:**
- How many hours per day is "too much" for a student?
- Which platforms are most associated with high addiction risk?
- Does social media usage correlate with mental health and sleep quality?
- What is *my* personal risk level based on my habits?

## Dataset

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Source | Kaggle — Social Media Addiction Among Students |
| Records | 705 students |
| Features | 13 variables |
| Countries | Multiple |
| Target Variable | Addiction Score (1–10) / Risk Level |

### Features Description

| Feature | Type | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| `Age` | Numerical | Student age |
| `Gender` | Categorical | Male / Female / Non-binary |
| `Academic_Level` | Categorical | High School / Undergraduate / Postgraduate |
| `Country` | Categorical | Country of student |
| `Avg_Daily_Usage_Hours` | Numerical | Average hours spent on social media per day |
| `Primary_Platform` | Categorical | Most used platform (Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, etc.) |
| `Affects_Academic_Performance` | Boolean | Self-reported academic impact |
| `Sleep_Hours_Per_Night` | Numerical | Average nightly sleep hours |
| `Mental_Health_Score` | Numerical | Self-reported mental health (1–10) |
| `Relationship_Status` | Categorical | Single / In a relationship |
| `Conflicts_Over_Social_Media` | Boolean | Whether social media causes relationship conflicts |
| `Addicted_Score` | Numerical | Target variable — addiction level (1–10) |

---

## Key Findings

- Students using social media **5+ hours/day** show significantly higher addiction scores
+- **TikTok and Instagram** users report the highest average addiction scores compared to other platforms
+- Strong negative correlation between **sleep hours** and addiction score (more addicted = less sleep)
+- Students reporting **academic performance impact** average an addiction score **2.3 points higher** than those who do not
+- **Mental health score** inversely correlates with addiction score (r approximately -0.62)
